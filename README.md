# RustIndexMaker

This project takes a text file and generates an index for the text file.

An index consists of a few statistics about the file at the top, followed by a list of all unique words in the file in alphabetical order, along with all the lines each word appears on and the frequency of the word.

To run: `cargo run infile outfile`
